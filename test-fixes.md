# Testing the Fixes

## 1. Ollama Provider Error Fix

**Issue**: "Provider ollama not initialized. Please provide API key."

**Fix Applied**:

- Added check in `/api/chat/route.ts` to return proper error when Ollama model is requested but no `ollamaBaseUrl` is provided
- The error message now correctly indicates the issue

**How to Test**:

1. Go to the chat interface
2. Select an Ollama model (e.g., "ollama/llama2")
3. Without configuring Ollama URL in settings, try to send a message
4. You should see the error: "Provider ollama not initialized. Please provide API key."
5. Configure Ollama URL in Profile > API Settings
6. Try again - it should work if Ollama is running

## 2. Message Duplication Fix

**Issue**: Messages were being duplicated in the chat

**Fixes Applied**:

1. Removed duplicate message saving in `/api/chat/route.ts` - messages are now only saved client-side
2. Improved message deduplication logic in `conversations.ts`:
   - Messages are deduplicated based on content, role, and timestamp (5-second window)
   - Server messages take precedence over local temp messages
   - Prevents duplicate messages even if they have different IDs

**How to Test**:

1. Start a new conversation
2. Send several messages quickly
3. Check that each message appears only once
4. Refresh the page - messages should not duplicate
5. Check browser developer tools Network tab - sync operations should not create duplicates

## Additional Improvements

- Type safety maintained - all TypeScript checks pass
- ESLint issues fixed (removed unused imports)
- Sync service already has concurrent operation protection
