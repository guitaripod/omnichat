# T3 Chat Cloneathon Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a production-level AI chat application to win the T3 Chat Cloneathon  
**Timeline**: 9 days (Deadline: June 17, 2025)  
**Prize Target**: 1st Place ($5,000)

## Tech Stack Decision

### Recommended Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) instead of Astro
  - Reason: Better suited for real-time chat apps with streaming, SSR/CSR flexibility, and extensive ecosystem
  - Astro is great for content sites but lacks the real-time capabilities needed here
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes + Cloudflare Workers for edge functions
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) for chat history + R2 for file storage
- **Auth**: Clerk or Auth.js with Cloudflare Workers KV for sessions
- **Payments**: Stripe with webhook handlers on Workers
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for rapid development
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK for unified LLM interface

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Time Management**

   - Use shadcn/ui components to save UI development time
   - Prioritize core requirements first
   - Have fallback plans for complex features

2. **Technical Challenges**

   - Ollama integration might be complex - have WebSocket fallback
   - Streaming with edge functions can be tricky - test early
   - D1 has limitations - design schema carefully

3. **Competition Strategy**
   - Focus on unique features others might miss (Ollama support)
   - Ensure exceptional UX and performance
   - Make the app actually useful beyond the competition

## Success Metrics

- All core requirements implemented ✓
- At least 5 bonus features completed ✓
- Sub-100ms response times on edge ✓
- Zero security vulnerabilities ✓
- Clean, maintainable codebase ✓
- Compelling demo with real use cases ✓

## Daily Standup Schedule

- **Morning**: Review progress, adjust priorities
- **Midday**: Code implementation sprint
- **Evening**: Test features, fix bugs
- **Night**: Plan next day, update documentation

## Additional Considerations

### What Sets Us Apart

1. **Local LLM Support**: Most competitors will skip Ollama
2. **Production Security**: Enterprise-grade with Cloudflare
3. **Real Monetization**: Working payments from day one
4. **Performance**: Edge-first architecture
5. **Developer Experience**: Plugin system for extensibility

### Learning Opportunities

- Modern React patterns with Next.js
- Edge computing with Cloudflare Workers
- Real-time streaming architectures
- Production payment integrations
- Security best practices
